    Students often struggle with processing large volumes of content throughout the course of their studies. This in turn will lead to a decrease in student productivity. Utilizing an effective summarization tool, students can better prepare for exams, improve their own summarization skills via learning by comparison, and avoid wasting time on low-quality content by skimming the summary. The Nub 1.0 project utilizes an effective deep learning framework to develop a summarizer specialized in educational content.
